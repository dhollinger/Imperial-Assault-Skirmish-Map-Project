#### Notes
* Recommended shop & product: [PixArtPrinting PVC Banners](https://www.pixartprinting.com/signage/banners-mesh/pvc-banner/)
* PixArtPrinting *does* print 300 DPI JPGs (created with this script) in addition to PDFs, even though they ask for PDFs initially.
* The JPG files are very large so some people have trouble seeing them on their computer. Give them some time if you have an older computer
* Questions? See [Boardwars](http://boardwars.eu/ia-maps/) and [New Orders](https://neworders.xyz/imperial-assault-skirmish-map-project/)
